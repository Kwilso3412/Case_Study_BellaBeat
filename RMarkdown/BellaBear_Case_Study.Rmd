## Overview

The following case study was completed apart of the Google Data Analytics Professionals course. It is based on the fictional Company BellaBeat a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. 

In this scenario I was tasked with helping Bellabeat become a potential big player in the global smart device market. The Cofounder and Chief Creatitve Officer,Urška Sršen, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunites for the company. Along with Sršen another key stake holder is Sando Mur a mathmetichian and Bellabeats cofounder. 

The company offers a variety of products such as:

* Bellabeat App
* Leaf: a classic wellness tracker
* Time: a wellness watch combines timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology
to track user activity
* Spring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology
* Bellabeat membership: a subscription-based membership program for users.

## Buisness Task


In this scenario I have been tasked with completing the following requirements for the key stakeholders:

1. Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.
2. select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation

Through completing the tasks this report will explain to key stakeholders:

1. What are some trends in smart device usuage?
2. How could the trends apply to the bellabeat customer?
3. How can both my team members and stakeholders use these insishts to make data driven decisoins

## Analysis

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Data gathering and cleaning phase
The analysis was completed using the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (FFTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). The FFTD dataset is open to the public and can be found on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/#). 

For the analysis I first cleaned and organized the data using excel when I pulled the raw data file from FFTD I noticed that there were multiple spread sheets that had overlapping data. To make sure I was not looking at repeated data I combined all of them into one file using the XLOOKUP function. Using this feature I was able to bring in the data from [the four spread sheets and compile it into one data set](https://github.com/Kwilso3412/Case_Study_BellaBeat/tree/main/FitBit%20Tracker%20data) that I could analyze. 

During this stage I noticed something interesting from the data. When it came to overall logging the active distance with the fitness tracker it was very rare or noe at all. There were also inconsistent metrics being recorded when users are either Very active or Moderately active. However, when it it came to light active distance tracking, the results were overwhelmingly positive. With showing results that at least everyday each user was engagin in light activity. 


### Analysis phase

### How anlaysis was conducted

For the analysis portion of this case study it was completed using [SQL and BigQuery database](https://github.com/Kwilso3412/Case_Study_BellaBeat/tree/main/SQL%20Query%20Code). 

I broke the large data down to answer the query's below 
  * What was the Average activity per day?
  * What was each users Average Activity?
  * What was the Average of all the users?
  
Once I had my results I took them out of the data base and stored them in a [seperate folder](https://github.com/Kwilso3412/Case_Study_BellaBeat/tree/main/SQL%20Query%20Code/Results). Then Used a combination of R and Tableu to visualize the results. 

### Results 

The following metrics were used to complete analysis
  * Total Calories Burned
  * Total Steps taken
  * Total Distance Traveled
  * Total Distance Tracked

Through analysis of these metrics I found something interesting in the data. I noticed that in each of the data there was an outlier throwing off my day and, in each plot, it was a single point on May 12th. For each metric there was a significant drop in the data recorded. There are no significant holidays on this day unless a vast majority of people celebrate National Limerick Day and World Migratory Bird Day, and I am just unaware. I decided it was safe to remove this data point. 

From the data I found that the average user:
  * Burned 2,304 Calories
  * Took 7,638 Steps
  * Traveled 5 miles
  * Tracked 5 miles 

It is a good sign that the averge total distance traveled and the total distance tracked are the same because that means that the fitness tracker is working properly and tracking all the miles the users walk. 

After reviewing the data for all the data for the averages for across all users. I wanted to see what the users were averaging per day.

The first metric I analyzed was calories per day. After isolating just the calories in sql I used the code below to plot a scatterplot and included a treadline to see how it would progress. The Plot shows a downward trend showing that as time goes on users burn less calories

## Conclusions

The analysis was a success as I was able to find out key information regarding our users and how they interact with the fitness tracker. 

Form our sample size we gathered that users are more likely to engage in light activity (i.e. walking, light bike ride, etc.) than engaging with activities that are considered moderate or very active (i.e. running, rock climbing, etc.).

I also noticed that users were not inclined to log in this activity, a possible reason for user not logging their activity could be that they simply did not fill the need to log the data since they did not think they doing their regular tasks or they may have forgotten to log the activity. 

A way that we could improve this metric would be to have a setting in the app that automatically logs the data for the user. This option can be toggled on and off depending on the users preference and they will still have the choice to manually log in the information. 

Another insight that I found was that as time went on the calories burned decrease. This could be another result in users not engaging in moderate or active activity. This shows the potential of being a issue because our customers bought our product because their goal is to lose weight and live healthier lives. If they are noticing that they are not losing weight or worse gaining weight it could lead to the loss of customers. 

A possible solution would be to integrate a weekly fitness goal feature in our app that could be tracked on the fitness tracker. We could have the users create their own goals or give them a few generic goals such as, walking 10,000 steps for the week, Running 5 miles for the week, weight loss goals and so on. These goals would be tracked on a day by day basis and then every Sunday the user can read a report of their activity and ways to improve if they fell short. 

Apart of the weekly goals we could have daily advice blogs to help promote healthy living. The articles would be short and take the average reader no longer that 2 minutes to read. This will help to encourage our users to stay the course and reach their fitness goals.
